# FlappyBird-Notes
This repo consists of recording the whole directory, consisting of essentially following Cherno's flappy bird's series' first 8 episodes. And I will add my notes to a certain folder, which will then be used to document everything. Which then, I will create another FlappyBird Java repo, which will contain the actual code that actually runs the game!
